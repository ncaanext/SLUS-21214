## BCS Ranking Fix WITHOUT editing functions

Change 38FF5C to:

80 00 05 24 09 3C 01 3C

80 is the number of teams + 1 (in this instance it's 127 teams, so we set this value to 128)

09 is a modifier that will need to be adjusted through experimentation so BCS rankings remain 1.000 or less and realistic.  For 127 teams, "09" seems to be a good value.  It will likely need to be different depending on the number of teams.
